# Pulsar Prediction Problem  
This project aims to create a machine learning model for identifying the signals from pulsars (a type of massive stars almost  similar in mass and gravitational pull to the more popular black holes) so that we could study more about them and fundamental behavior of matter and charges.  <br><br>
But the problem is that the data available for pulsars are very less as only a few of them are identified till now as the manual calculations involving identification of these giants is a tedius task. <br><br> 
So to overcome this drawback we approach this problem by using SMOTE , a techique used in imbalance learning , to create synthetic datapoints mimicing the real pulsar values.  <br><br>
This is a good project for introduction to imbalanced data modelling.
